/**
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT PART OF THE DASHBOARD'S APPS SCRIPT PROJECT.
 *
 * An ADDITIVE addition to the *collection engine's* script project. Paste it
 * at the bottom of the engine's Code.gs and install its one trigger. Nothing
 * existing is modified: `onSignalEdit` and `fanOut_` are untouched, and the
 * checkbox keeps working exactly as it does today.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The dashboard needs "move the card to Invited" to fire the fan-out so Gaby
 * never touches the sheet. The obvious route — have the dashboard tick the
 * Confirmed checkbox — CANNOT work: Apps Script onEdit triggers fire only for
 * edits made by a human in the UI, never for edits made by a script or by the
 * Sheets API. The box would go green and nothing would run.
 *
 * So the dashboard writes the row exactly as a human tick would (name in A,
 * boolean true in B, Processed left empty) and this poll picks it up.
 *
 * Chosen over exposing a Web App endpoint on the engine (Option B) because it
 * is purely additive, needs no new public endpoint on a live script, and its
 * fallback is free: if the poll misbehaves, Gaby ticks the box and the
 * original trigger handles it with no code change.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DOUBLE-FIRE PROTECTION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three independent layers; this file is the third:
 *   1. Dashboard — the fire button only exists when no `Invite — kickoff sent`
 *      event exists for that (email, cycle). Firing writes it, so it vanishes.
 *   2. Proxy — refuses to write a Signal row if one for that client is already
 *      pending, or was already processed this month.
 *   3. HERE — the same `Processed` guard `onSignalEdit` uses, claimed BEFORE
 *      the work runs, under the same script lock so poll and checkbox cannot
 *      race each other.
