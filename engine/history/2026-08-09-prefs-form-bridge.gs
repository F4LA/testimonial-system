/**
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT PART OF THE DASHBOARD'S APPS SCRIPT PROJECT.
 *
 * An ADDITIVE addition to the *collection engine's* script project. Paste it
 * at the bottom of the engine's Code.gs, set one script property, and run the
 * installer. Nothing existing is modified.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The raffle view (spec §4.4) and the reviews view (§4.5) are written as if
 * the system "already knows" three signals per client. Two of them —
 * photo permission and the Google-review self-report — exist only inside the
 * preferences-form responses sheet and were never written to the event log.
 * The third, podcast consent (D-097), is the same.
 *
 * Nothing read that sheet. Verified: the engine's nine Stage strings contain
 * no preferences handler at all. Without this bridge the raffle would show
 * every client as "not qualified" forever — the same failure class as D-085,
 * where the coach form routed correctly and silently wrote no event.
 *
 * Raffle condition 2 (questionnaire / testimonial) is deliberately NOT written
 * here: it is the existing client-video event. No new event for it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE logEvent_ TRAP (D-085) — why this works
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This handler runs from an onFormSubmit trigger bound to the RESPONSES sheet,
 * not to the engine's container. `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()`
 * therefore returns the responses file, which has no Event Log tab. Before
 * D-085 that made `logEvent_` hit `if (!tab) return;` and drop the write
 * silently, with the execution still reporting Completed.
 *
 * The deployed `logEvent_` now falls back to `openById(prop_('SIGNAL_SHEET_ID'))`,
 * so writes from a foreign-bound trigger land correctly. This file depends on
 * that fix being present — `checkPrefsFormWiring()` asserts it before you
 * install anything.

/**
 * Event vocabulary — CONFIRMED and validated live 2026-08-09 (all four strings).
 *
 * A dedicated `Preferences — ` group rather than reusing `Review — self-reported`
 * (which already exists in the dashboard's ALLOWED_STAGES), for one structural
 * reason: D-066 says the two review signals are NEVER merged. If the
 * form-sourced self-report were written as `Review — self-reported`, the
 * dashboard could also write that string, and a person could hand-enter a
 * "self-report" that opens the raffle. Keeping the client's own answers in
 * their own group, listed as engine-owned, makes that structurally impossible
 * rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * The group also makes provenance obvious in the timeline: everything here is
 * the client speaking for themselves, AUTO, from one form.
