/**
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT PART OF THE DASHBOARD'S APPS SCRIPT PROJECT.
 *
 * These two functions are a ONE-TIME repair for the *collection engine's*
 * script project (the container-bound script on "Testimonial Collection —
 * Signal & Event Log"). Paste them there, run them, then delete them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * On 2026-08-07 the engine's Triggers list contained only two triggers:
 *   onSignalEdit · sendMonthlyNominationMessage
 * `onCoachFormSubmit` was missing. That is a genuine launch gap — the coach
 * form is one of the five collected inputs and was never abandoned by any
 * decision. Without the trigger, coach responses at launch would vanish:
 * nothing routes them to folder 04 and nothing writes the event.
 *
 * (The sibling `onClientVideoSubmit` is ALSO missing, and that one is
 * CORRECT — decisions D-059 / D-063 / D-065 replaced the form upload with a
 * direct upload to the client's Drive folder 03. Do NOT install it.)
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST RE-RUN installTriggers()
 * -------------------------------------
 *   1. It deletes ALL triggers first. A failure mid-run leaves zero triggers
 *      and a dead fan-out.
 *   2. It reinstalls onClientVideoSubmit whenever CLIENT_FORM_SHEET_ID is
 *      still set — resurrecting the path D-059 deliberately killed.
 *   3. It needlessly rebinds the working onSignalEdit trigger.
 *
 * These helpers are strictly additive: they create one trigger and delete
 * nothing. Run checkCoachFormWiring() first — it only reads.
 *
 * NOTE ON ACCOUNTS: the Apps Script Triggers page shows only the CURRENT
 * user's triggers, and a trigger runs as whoever created it. Run these from
 * the same Google account that already owns onSignalEdit — i.e. the account
 * that sees those two triggers in the list.
 */


/**
 * READ-ONLY preflight. Verifies the property points at the right responses
 * sheet and that the question title the engine reads actually exists.
 *
 * The header check matters: onCoachFormSubmit reads
 * row[prop_('COACH_FORM_HDR_CLIENT')]. If that title does not match the
 * form's real question, clientName is empty, rosterByName_('') fails, and
 * EVERY submission logs `Flag: selector "" does not resolve...` with an
 * empty Client email — unattributed and invisible on any client card.
